## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This code runs with Python version 3.* and requires some libraries, to install theses libraries you will need to execute: </br>
` $ conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt `

You will need to download Stackoverflowâ€™s 2019 Annual Developer Survey and put in the same folder. You can find the data to download [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey). </br>


## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:</br>
1. What are the most important characteristics/features of developers with respect to their salaries? </br>
2. Based on these characteristics, what makes the difference of low paid and high paid devs regarding the use of: </br>
3. The country they work in?
4. The programming language they use?
5. The dev envorinments they use?
6. The platforms they use?
7. And what databases they use? </br>

## File Description <a name="files"></a>

**Analyze_SO_data.ipynb**: Notebook containing the data analysis. </br>
**./survey_results_public_19.csv**: Stackoverflow's 2019 Annual Developer Survey data. </br>

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@c0knaak/how-to-increase-your-salary-as-a-developer-55b38509fa5f)
